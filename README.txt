These files were created as a way to learn how to manipulate the Constant Contact API using Python. While I intended the functions to be useful, they would need quite a bit of manipulation, at this point, to be useful. 

I'm hoping to update this in the future to add additional functionality and re-work a few of the functions to be more intuitive.
